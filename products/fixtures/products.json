      "description": "The OLED display on this Samsung S90D TV brings a bit of cinema magic to your living room. Because the pixels are self-lit, the TV can accurately control the shadows and highlights. Everything looks much more real with deep blacks and billions of colours that burst from the screen. OLED HDR+ throws you right into lifelike action and lets you see every little detail in mind-boggling clarity - those movie monsters just got a whole lot scarier. The NQ4 AI Gen2 Processor is the brain of the TV. It's busy in the background boosting the brightness, contrast, and sound of everything you watch. Plus, HD content gets an upgrade to near 4K quality. And it's able to do this on the fly using AI and 20 neural networks. Pretty smart.",
