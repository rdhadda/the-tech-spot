### Purpose

The Tech Spot is designed to provide users with an online platform where they can browse, purchase, and learn about the latest tech products, such as TVs, laptops, game consoles, and mobile phones. It aims to offer a convenient shopping experience with detailed product information and secure payment options.

#### Security Features

- User Authentication: Account creation and login require strong passwords and email verification to secure user profiles.

#### Target Audience

- Tech Enthusiasts: People interested in the latest gadgets and technology products.

- General Consumers: Anyone seeking electronic products for everyday use.

- Students and Professionals: Users looking for devices like laptops or mobile phones for work or study.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![The-Tech-Spot](documentation\images\the-tech-spot-colour-scheme.png)

The chosen colour scheme is designed to convey a sense of trust and modernity to The Tech Stop store. 

I believe, together, these colors create a balanced and visually appealing design that reinforces the siteâ€™s credibility and modernity, while ensuring a positive user experience.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- Fira Sans Extra Condensed - All text across the site

![Typography](documentation\images\the-tech-spot-fire-sans-condensed.png)

- Bowlby One - The Tech Spot logo

![Typography](documentation\images\the-tech-spot-bowlby-one.png)

### Imagery

All images on the webpage were taken from Currys.co.uk. I have credited these in the [credits](#credits) section.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

### Database Design

The Tech Spot is based on a relational database. The database is made up of 7 tables:

1. Category
2. Product
3. Order
4. OrderLineItem
5. Contact
6. UserProfile
7. User (Django Default Table)

The relationship between the tables are as follows:

1. Category to Product - One-to-Many - One category can have many products

2. Product to OrderLineItem - Many-to-One - One product can be associated with multiple instances of OrderLineItem

3. Order to OrderLineItem - One-to-Many - A single order can have multiple OrderLineItem entries

4. Contact - This is a standalone table which doesn't have a relationship to any other table.

5. UserProfile to User - One-to-One - Only one user can have one user profile.

### Features

All pages of the website have the following elements in common:

- Navbar - The navbar consists of:

    - The Tech Spot logo which acts as a link back to the homepage.
    - A search bar to allow a user to easily search products. 
    - An account icon which allows a user to login/sign up.
    - A basket link which takes the user through to the bag page
    - Navigation links to different product categories

![Navbar](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-navbar.png)

- Footer - This consists of a link to the contact form, which allows a shopper to contact the store. Social links and reference to stripe payments
