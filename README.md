## User Experience (UX)

### Purpose

The Tech Spot is designed to provide users with an online platform where they can browse, purchase, and learn about the latest tech products, such as TVs, laptops, game consoles, and mobile phones. It aims to offer a convenient shopping experience with detailed product information and secure payment options.

#### Why The Site is Needed

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![The-Tech-Spot](documentation\images\the-tech-spot-colour-scheme.png)

The chosen colour scheme is designed to convey a sense of trust and modernity to The Tech Stop store. 

I believe, together, these colors create a balanced and visually appealing design that reinforces the siteâ€™s credibility and modernity, while ensuring a positive user experience.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- Fira Sans Extra Condensed - All text across the site

![Typography](documentation\images\the-tech-spot-fire-sans-condensed.png)

- Bowlby One - The Tech Spot logo

![Typography](documentation\images\the-tech-spot-bowlby-one.png)

### Imagery

All images on the webpage were taken from Currys.co.uk. I have credited these in the [credits](#credits) section.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using Balsamiq.

### Database Design

The Tech Spot is based on a relational database. The database is made up of 7 tables:

1. Category
2. Product
3. Order
4. OrderLineItem
5. Contact
6. UserProfile
7. User (Django Default Table)

The relationship between the tables are as follows:

1. Category to Product - One-to-Many - One category can have many products

2. Product to OrderLineItem - Many-to-One - One product can be associated with multiple instances of OrderLineItem

3. Order to OrderLineItem - One-to-Many - A single order can have multiple OrderLineItem entries

4. Contact - This is a standalone table which doesn't have a relationship to any other table.

5. UserProfile to User - One-to-One - Only one user can have one user profile.

6. UserProfile to Order - One-to-Many - One user can have many orders.

![Database Schema](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-database-schema.png)

### Features

All pages of the website have the following elements in common:

- Navbar - The navbar consists of:

    - The Tech Spot logo which acts as a link back to the homepage.
    - A search bar to allow a user to easily search products. 
    - An account icon which allows a user to login/sign up.
    - A basket link which takes the user through to the bag page
    - Navigation links to different product categories

![Navbar](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-navbar.png)

- Footer - This consists of a link to the contact form, which allows a shopper to contact the store. Social links and reference to stripe payments

![Footer](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-footer.png)

#### Defensive Programming

Defensive programming has been used throughout the site where necessary to prevent unauthorized access to certain URLs. This has been achieved by using the @loginrequired decorator for certain functions. As a secondary defense the views also check whether the user is a superuser if not a toast is displayed informing the user they do not have access to the URL.

#### Home Page

The home page consist of a welcome message, a shop now button which takes the shopper through to all the products available and a grid of images related to the store.

![Homepage](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-homepage.png)

#### Products Page

The products page displays all of the products available within the store. The products are displayed utilizing a bootstrap grid and card class. Each product shows the name, image, price, category and rating. If the user is a superuser each product shows a update/delete link allowing the superuser to maintain the store.

The page also shows the number of products being displayed on the page on the top left of the page. Additionally if a certain category if being used then a link back to all products is shown and if a search term is used, this term will also be displayed.

To the right of the screen is a sort box allowing the shopper to sort products by price, category and rating.

![Products Page](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-products-page.png)

#### Product Detail Page

Once a user has clicked on a product from the products page they will be taken through to the product detail page. This page shows an image of the product, title, price rating, category and description. If the user is a super user the update/delete links are also displayed here allowing for easy store maintenance 

There is also a quantity input with plus and minus buttons allowing shoppers to select their desired quantity of a product. A shopper is unable to select less than one product. 

Shoppers then have the option to add the quantity to their basket. Once added to the basket a toast is displayed showing the shopper what has been added to the basket and a link to go to secure checkout from the toast.

There is also a keep shopping button which takes the shopper back to the previous page.

![Product Detail Page](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-product-detail-page.png)

#### Bag Page

The bag page displays all of the products which the shopper added to their bag. An image, description, product price, quantity and subtotal is shown for each product. 

The quantity field allows the shopper to update the quantity of the product directly from their shopping bag. The delete link allows the shopper to delete the entire product from their shopping bag.

The subtotal field calculates the quantity multiplied by the product price to give the shopper a subtotal for that product.

The page also displays a bag total, delivery total and grand total.

The keep shopping button takes the shopper back to the products page and the secure checkout button navigates the shopper through to the checkout process.

![Bag Page](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-bag-page.png)

#### Checkout Page

The checkout page requires the shopper to fill out a form based upon the UserProfile model. If a user is logged in the name and e-mail field are pre-populated. If a user has filled out their profile with their delivery information, the form will be pre-populated with this information. If the user has not pre-populated their delivery information they have the option to save the delivery information to their profile via a checkout box to allow for faster checkout for their next purchase. 

If a shopper does not have a user account/profile then the information will need to be manually entered. There will also be a link displayed underneath the country field to prompt the user to login or to create an account. 

Underneath the details and delivery section is a payment input which is processed by stripe. If a user enters incorrect information a warning message will be displayed underneath the payment input.

The adjust bag button will take the user back to the bag page. The complete order button will complete the purchase and take the user through to the checkout success page. Underneath the complete order button is a warning to the shopper, highlighting to them how much their card will be charged for the purchase.

On the right hand side of the checkout page, shows an order summary to the shopper.

![Checkout Page](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-checkout-page.png)

#### Checkout Overlay

Once a shopper has clicked on the complete order button a spinning overlay will be displaying, indicating to the shopper that their payment is being processed. If the payment is unsuccessful the shopper will be re-directed to the checkout page.

#### Checkout Success Page

Once the payment has been processed, the shopper will be presented with the checkout success page. This shows a summary of what has been purchased and informs the shopper that a confirmation email will be sent out to them.

A success toast is also displayed indicating that the purchase was successful.

At the bottom of the summary is a button which will take the shopper through to the stores latest deals.

![Checkout Success](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-checkout-success.png)

#### Profile Page

The profile page shows the users default delivery information. Users can update this information at anytime by entering their information and clicking on the update information button. If successful the user will be presented with a success toast. 

On the right hand side of the page displays the users past shopping history. The order number is a link to the order confirmation.

The cancel button re-directs the user through to the products page. 

![Contact Page](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-contact-page.png)

#### Add Product (Super Users Only)

Superusers have the ability to add products to the store directly from the website rather than through Django admin. The superuser is presented with a form which is based on the product model. This can be accessed via Account > Product Management link in the navbar. Required fields are marked with an star (*). 

The cancel button takes the user back through to the products page.

The add product button adds the product to the database and directs the user to the product detail page of the newly created product.

#### Edit Product Page (Super Users Only)

Similar to the add product page, super users are able to edit products directly from the website. The edit product page is accessed from the update links next to the products on the product page and product detail page. The form will be pre-populated with the product details and a toast displayed showing the user which product they're updating. From here the superuser can make any necessary amendments.

The cancel button wil take the user back to the products page.

The update product will update the product details and directs the user to the product detail page of the updated product.

![Edit Product](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-edit-product-page.png)

When a superuser clicks on a delete link for a product they are presented with a modal confirming whether they would like to delete the product. 

![Delete Modal](documentation/images/the-tech-spot-delete-modal.png)

#### 400, 403, 404 & 500 Page

I've implemented my own custom error pages. These pages all follow the same design with a message indicated to the user that an error has occurred.
